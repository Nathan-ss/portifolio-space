          I started my career studying Computer Engineering, independent design
          freelancers and a programming internship in Php, and soon I started
          working on some projects that I gained a lot of visibility, I always
          tried to improve myself, so I learned to edit videos, and create
          motions. After I joined the army reserve, with honors and discipline,
          I joined the biggest podcast producer in Brazil as a cutting editor,
          in the beginning I did everything, and it didn't take long for me to
          grow there inside.
          <br />
          <br />
          I never stopped my studies, so I went through positions such as head
          of cuts, media editor, design and programmer. <br />
          <br />
          I'm a person who loves challenges, so when a full stack vacancy
          appeared I accepted, where as a frontend programmer I had to learn to
          work with the backend, I learned a lot about project management, and I
          improved my English.
